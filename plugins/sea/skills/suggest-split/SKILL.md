name: suggest-split
description: >
  Use when a pull request is too large or covers too many concerns to
  review safely and the author wants help splitting it into smaller PRs.
  Reads the diff, categorises the changes by type (refactor, migration,
  feature, tests, infrastructure, documentation), proposes a 2-4 way
  split with dependency ordering, and emits the exact git commands to
  make each new branch. Read-only — does NOT execute the commands. The
  founder copies the commands, runs them (or asks a developer to), and
  opens one PR per piece. Designed for non-technical founders who get a
  high-severity PR Hygiene finding from `/code-review` (PH-01 Scope or
  PH-02 Size) and don't know what "split the PR" actually involves.

# Suggest Split — Help an author divide a large PR into smaller ones

When invoked, take a pull request that's too large or too mixed to
review safely and produce a concrete split proposal — what each smaller
PR contains, what order to merge them in, and the git commands to make
each new branch. The skill is **read-only**: it suggests; the author
(or their developer) executes.

This skill is the natural follow-on to `/code-review` when PH-01 (Scope)
or PH-02 (Size) fires high. `/code-review` flags the problem; this
skill produces the actionable how-to.

## Input

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | Yes | PR number (`142`), branch ref (`feat/payments`), or commit range (`main..HEAD`) |
| `project-name` | No | Output folder under `.architecture/`. Defaults to working-directory basename |

**Example invocations:**

```
/sea:suggest-split 142
/sea:suggest-split feat/payments
/sea:suggest-split main..HEAD
```

If the target is a PR number and `gh` is available, treat it as a
GitHub PR and pull metadata. Otherwise resolve from local git.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the diff

```bash
WORK="/tmp/suggest-split/{project}-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$WORK"

if command -v gh >/dev/null && [[ "$TARGET" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  gh pr view "$TARGET" --json number,title,baseRefName,headRefName \
    > "$WORK/pr-meta.json"
  gh pr diff "$TARGET" > "$WORK/diff.patch"
  BASE=$(jq -r .baseRefName "$WORK/pr-meta.json")
  HEAD=$(jq -r .headRefName "$WORK/pr-meta.json")
fi

git diff --name-status "$BASE...$HEAD" > "$WORK/files.txt"
git log --format='%H %s' "$BASE..$HEAD" > "$WORK/commits.txt"
```

### 2. Categorise changes by file path

Read each changed file and put it into a category. Heuristics (apply
in order — first match wins):

| Pattern | Category |
|---|---|
| Path matches `migrations/`, `db/migrate/`, `prisma/migrations/`, `alembic/versions/` | **migration** |
| Path matches `*.sql`, `*.proto`, `*.graphql`, `*.avsc`, `openapi.*`, `swagger.json` | **schema** |
| Path matches `*.test.*`, `*_test.*`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `spec/` | **test** |
| Path matches `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, `k8s/`, `helm/`, `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci*` | **infra** |
| Path matches `*.md`, `docs/`, `README*` | **docs** |
| Path matches package-lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Cargo.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`) | **lockfile** |
| Commit message of any commit touching this file starts with `refactor:` or `chore:` | **refactor** |
| Everything else | **feature** |

A single file may fit two categories (e.g., a migration file with a
schema change inside). Use the most specific. Migration > schema > test
> infra > docs > lockfile > refactor > feature.

### 3. Group categories into a proposed split

Default split when the categorisation has variety:

| Order | Piece | Contents | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Refactor** | All `refactor` files. Behaviour-preserving changes. | None — can merge first; should not change tests. |
| 2 | **Schema / Migration** | All `schema` and `migration` files plus immediately-adjacent code (e.g., new model classes) | Depends on Refactor merging first (so the schema is added against the latest structure) |
| 3 | **Infrastructure** | `infra` files | Depends on Schema (if the infra change supports the new schema) |
| 4 | **Feature** | All `feature` files plus the matching `test` files | Depends on Schema + Infrastructure |
| (n/a) | **Docs** | Bundled into the piece that introduces the documented behaviour. Avoid a docs-only PR unless the docs change is unrelated. |
| (n/a) | **Lockfiles** | Bundled into whichever piece introduces the dependency change that produced them. Don't split lockfiles into their own PR — they're regeneration, not a change. |

The split has **at most four pieces**. If the diff doesn't have enough
variety to produce four meaningful pieces, propose fewer (2 or 3).
Single-piece "the diff is already atomic" outputs are valid — emit a
short explanation and stop.

If the diff has more variety than four pieces (e.g., touches 8
independent subsystems), propose a two-pass split: recommend splitting
once now into broad pieces, then re-running `/sea:suggest-split` on the
larger pieces.

### 4. Generate git commands per piece

For each piece, emit the exact git command sequence to create its
branch from `main` (or the agreed base) and stage just that piece's
files. Use **`git checkout -b`** + **`git checkout <head> -- <files>`**
pattern (cherry-pick-style without using cherry-pick — safer for
non-experts; doesn't rewrite history).

Example per-piece block:

```bash
# Piece 1 of 3 — Refactor
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feat/payments-refactor

# Bring just the refactor files from the original branch
git checkout feat/payments -- \
  src/payments/client.ts \
  src/payments/types.ts \
  src/lib/http-client.ts

git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: extract HTTP client and payment types"
git push -u origin feat/payments-refactor

# Then: open a PR for feat/payments-refactor.
# Wait for it to merge before starting Piece 2.
```

Always:
- Include `git checkout main && git pull` to start from the freshest base
- Use clear branch names with `feat/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `infra/`
  prefixes per Conventional Commits style
- Group `git checkout <head> -- <files>` calls when the file list is
  long (use line continuations, not one command per file)
- Stop short of opening the PR — the author does that step

### 5. Write the suggestion artifact

Write to **the originating review bundle** if one exists (the `/code-review`
report directory for this PR), so the suggestion lives alongside the
review that flagged the split:

```
.architecture/{project}/code-reviews/PR-{number}-{TIMESTAMP}/
└── SPLIT-SUGGESTION.md
```

If no review bundle exists (the user ran `/sea:suggest-split`
standalone), create a new bundle at the same path pattern with the
suggestion file and no REVIEW.md.

### 6. Summarise to the user (FE-01..FE-11 MUST — short)

Founder English. Plain language. The artifact does the work.

**Standard shape (3-4 sentences):**

> Looked at your pull request. It splits cleanly into {N} pieces — {one-line summary}. The proposed split and the exact git commands for each piece are at `.architecture/{project}/code-reviews/PR-{number}-{TIMESTAMP}/SPLIT-SUGGESTION.md`. Run them in order — merge Piece 1's pull request before starting Piece 2.

---

## SPLIT-SUGGESTION.md format

Two tiers, same convention as `/code-review`'s REVIEW.md.

### Tier 1 — For the author

```markdown
# Split suggestion for PR-{number}

> **Why split:** {1-2 sentences in plain English. Reference the
> hygiene findings from the originating /code-review if applicable.
> Acknowledge the work that's there before suggesting changes.}

## The split — {N} pieces

### Piece 1 — {name in plain English}

**What's in it:** {1-2 sentences in plain language. List the {N} files briefly.}

**Why this comes first:** {dependency explanation in plain English. "This is a behaviour-preserving change — nothing else depends on it, and it's the safest to merge first."}

**When this is merged:** Open the PR for Piece 1, get it merged into `main`, then start Piece 2.

### Piece 2 — {name}
...

## After all pieces are merged

The original branch `{HEAD}` can be deleted — its changes will all be
on `main` via the smaller PRs.

If you'd rather not do the split, that's fine — the original PR is
still merge-able with the changes the code review suggested. The split
is a recommendation, not a requirement.
```

### Tier 2 — Technical detail (the git commands)

```markdown
## Technical detail — commands to make each piece

> Run these commands in order. Each piece becomes a new branch off the
> latest `main`. Open one PR per branch. Merge in dependency order
> (Piece 1 first, then Piece 2, etc.).

### Piece 1 — Refactor

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b refactor/extract-http-client

git checkout {HEAD} -- \
  src/lib/http-client.ts \
  src/payments/types.ts

git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: extract HTTP client and payment types"
git push -u origin refactor/extract-http-client

# Open the PR: gh pr create --base main --head refactor/extract-http-client
# Wait for merge before starting Piece 2.
```

### Piece 2 — Database migrations
...

### Piece N — Feature
...

## File-to-piece mapping

{Full inventory of every changed file and which piece it belongs to.
This is the audit trail — if the founder asks "where does
src/foo/bar.ts go?" the answer is here.}

| File | Status | Piece |
|---|---|---|
| `src/lib/http-client.ts` | added | 1 (refactor) |
| `src/payments/types.ts` | modified | 1 (refactor) |
| `migrations/20260521-coupons.sql` | added | 2 (migration) |
| `src/coupons/handler.ts` | added | 3 (feature) |
| `src/coupons/handler.test.ts` | added | 3 (feature) |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Categorisation rationale

{Short notes on any non-obvious categorisation decisions. Example:
"`src/payments/client.ts` could have been refactor or feature. Placed
in refactor because the commit log shows two `refactor:` commits
touching it before any `feat:` commit."}
```

## Gotchas

- **Read-only by design.** This skill never executes git commands. It
  proposes them. The author copies, the author runs (or asks a dev to).
  Per "executing actions with care" in CLAUDE.md, history-changing
  operations need explicit author opt-in.
- **Avoid cherry-pick.** The `git checkout -b` + `git checkout <head> -- <files>`
  pattern is safer for non-experts than `git cherry-pick`. It doesn't
  rewrite history; it doesn't get confused by merge commits; and if it
  goes wrong, `git reset --hard` undoes it.
- **Lockfiles aren't a piece.** Don't propose a lockfile-only PR.
  Lockfiles regenerate from `package.json` / `requirements.txt` /
  etc. — they're a side-effect, not a change.
- **Docs follow the change.** Don't propose a docs-only PR unless the
  docs change is genuinely unrelated to the code. Same-PR docs are
  cheaper to review.
- **Single-piece output is fine.** If the diff is already atomic and
  small, say so. "Your PR is already shaped well — no split needed.
  Address the code-review findings in the same branch."
- **Founder English on the summary.** The chat output is for the
  founder, not for the engineer. Strip internal IDs. Use plain
  language. The artifact carries the detail.

---

## Composition

- **With `/code-review`** — natural follow-on. When PH-01 or PH-02
  fires high, `/code-review`'s Tier 1 report names this skill as the
  next step. The suggestion artifact lives inside the same review
  bundle.
- **With `/sea:harden`** — independent. Harden implements deltas;
  split rearranges changes into PRs. They don't conflict.
- **With future `/sea:apply-split` (deferred)** — a v0.2 version of
  this skill could optionally execute the proposed git commands after
  explicit author confirmation. Out of scope for v0.1. The artifact's
  Tier 2 commands are designed to be both human-readable and
  machine-executable so the future apply skill can reuse them.
