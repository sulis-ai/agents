# Work Package Template

The required structure for `.architecture/{project}/work-packages/WP-NNN-{slug}.md`.
Every WP SEA produces uses this exact shape. Sections may grow; they may
not be omitted.

# removal_plan: null  # null only when subject_ownership: external

# Required for SUBSTITUTE-Strangle:
# removal_plan: "Legacy OrderService deleted by 2026-09-30 (after 100% traffic migrated)."

# Required for REORGANISE primitives (Move, Refactor, Inline, Merge, Decompose, Abstract):
# characterisation_test: "tests/legacy/characterisation/OrderService.test.ts"

# Optional — Documentation update (sulis-execution v0.6+ Step 5).
# If specified, the executor updates these files to reflect the WP's
# behaviour change. If absent, the executor auto-detects affected docs
# from the WP's modified source files (docstrings, README entries,
# OpenAPI specs, ADRs) and updates them.
# docs_to_update:
#   - README.md
#   - docs/api/cancel-subscription.md
#   - .architecture/{project}/adrs/ADR-014-subscription-states.md

# Optional — Post-deploy verification (sulis-execution v0.6+ Step 11).
# Allowed values:
#   security                — DEFAULT when field is absent. Spawns
#                             sulis-security:security-reviewer at
#                             merge SHA + staging URL.
#   security+performance    — placeholder for future perf-regression
#                             checks.
#   none                    — explicit opt-out. Use sparingly: only
#                             when the assessment would be provably
#                             redundant (e.g. docs-only WPs touching
#                             no source files).
# post_deploy_verification: security

# Status — supports the lifecycle states the orchestrator reads.
#   pending              — ready to dispatch when dependsOn complete
#   in_progress          — executor currently running this WP
#   done                 — Step 12 completed cleanly
#   blocked              — BLOCKER file written; awaiting resolution
#   dependency_blocked   — transitively blocked by another WP's BLOCKER
#   auto-draft           — created from a security finding (v0.7+); awaiting
#                          founder disposition via concierge slice-end review
# status: pending

# Auto-draft fields (sulis-execution v0.7+; populated when this WP was
# automatically created from a security finding at Step 11 of another
# WP). Absent for normal WPs.
# source_finding: SF-NNN
# severity: CONCERN | ADVISORY
# disposition: pending-review | approved | cancelled | duplicate-of-WP-NN
#   # pending-review (default for auto-draft WPs): awaiting founder
#   #                 disposition; concierge surfaces at slice-end.
#   # approved: founder approved; orchestrator dispatches; SEA may
#   #           need to flesh out the Contract first.
#   # cancelled: founder declined; rationale recorded in WP body.
#   # duplicate-of-WP-NN: finding's coverage delegated to existing WP.

# Optional — Model override for the executor (sulis-execution v0.8+).
# When absent (default), the executor inherits the calling session's
# model — typically Opus. No automatic substitution. The field exists
# for opt-in calibration experiments on specific WPs:
#   opus    — full reasoning. Default behaviour via inheritance.
#   sonnet  — faster; good for most code work but subject to rate
#             limits in some setups.
#   haiku   — fastest; suitable only for provably mechanical WPs
#             (pure config changes, pure renames, pure deletions).
#             Discouraged for RGB-cycle WPs unless empirically
#             calibrated.
# executor_model: opus

# Optional — Model override for the security-reviewer spawned at
# Step 11 (sulis-execution v0.8+). When absent, security-reviewer
# inherits the executor's model.
# security_model: opus

## Context

One paragraph. Which part of the architecture this WP touches. Which
PRIMITIVE_TREE nodes it advances. Why this WP exists.

Link to the TDD section: `[TDD §3.4](../TDD.md#34-adapters)`.

## Contract

The exact interfaces, types, and ports this WP introduces or modifies.
Code-level signatures only — not implementation. The Contract is what an
execution agent reads to know what to build.

Use code blocks with realistic types:

\`\`\`typescript
// domain/order/OrderRepository.ts (exists)
export interface OrderRepository {
  save(order: Order, idempotencyKey: IdempotencyKey): Promise<void>;
  findById(id: OrderId): Promise<Order | null>;
}

// infrastructure/persistence/PostgresOrderRepository.ts (this WP creates)
export class PostgresOrderRepository implements OrderRepository { ... }
\`\`\`

State invariants the contract preserves:

- Idempotency: `save()` with same `(id, idempotencyKey)` returns success without re-applying.
- Timeouts: transaction timeout 5s (NFR-04).
- Error mapping: provider errors translate to domain errors (`DuplicateOrderError`, `OrderNotFoundError`).

## Definition of Done

### Red — Failing tests written first

List every failing test by file path and test name. The execution agent
writes these tests before any implementation code.

- [ ] `tests/contracts/OrderRepositoryContract.ts::saves_and_retrieves_order`
- [ ] `tests/contracts/OrderRepositoryContract.ts::idempotent_save_returns_existing`
- [ ] `tests/contracts/OrderRepositoryContract.ts::findById_returns_null_for_missing`
- [ ] `tests/infrastructure/.../postgres-order-repository.test.ts::respects_5s_transaction_timeout` — chaos test, toxiproxy 6s latency
- [ ] `tests/infrastructure/.../postgres-order-repository.test.ts::emits_otel_span_with_table_attribute`
- [ ] `tests/infrastructure/.../postgres-order-repository.test.ts::redacts_pii_in_error_messages`

Include functional, edge-case, AND hardening assertions. Per `references/red-green-blue.md`
RGB-01, the hardening tests live in Red.

### Green — Implementation passes the tests

- [ ] All Red tests pass against ephemeral Postgres (testcontainers).
- [ ] Existing in-memory adapter still passes the shared contract test (no regression).
- [ ] Implementation follows `references/boring-code.md`:
  - Explicit types on public surface
  - No module-level state
  - No metaprogramming / reflection
- [ ] Coverage on new files ≥ 90%.

### Blue — Refactor within scope

- [ ] Duplication removed within file scope (e.g. save/update paths share an internal helper).
- [ ] Shared primitives extracted where ≥2 instances exist in this WP's diff.
- [ ] All tests still green.
- [ ] No new behaviour introduced.

## Sequence

- **dependsOn:** WP-XXX (reason), WP-YYY (reason)
- **blocks:** WP-ZZZ (reason)
- **Parallelisable with:** WP-AAA, WP-BBB (no overlapping file scope)

## Out of Scope

What this WP does NOT do. Helps the execution agent resist scope creep.

- Does NOT implement read-side projections (separate WP).
- Does NOT add the second adapter (separate WP).
- Does NOT change the domain entity (changes there require a new WP).

## Notes for the Executing Agent

Anything else the executor should know. Library choices already made,
gotchas in the existing code, links to relevant ADRs.

- Use `pg` driver (already in package.json).
- The migration for the `orders` table lives in `migrations/001_init.sql`
  from WP-002; no schema changes in this WP.
- See ADR-001 for the persistence trade-off rationale.

## Acceptance Evidence (filled at done)

## Why each field exists

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| `id` + `sequence_id` | Stable reference across the project and in dependency graphs |
| `dependsOn` / `blocks` | Prevents merge conflicts; drives parallelism analysis |
| `estimated_token_cost` | Lets an orchestrator route to the right model tier |
| `tdd_section` / `adrs` | Traceability — what design decision does this WP encode |
| `pillar` | Drives audit and verification — which MECE-3 pillar this WP advances |
| `primitive` | The change primitive (one of 22 in `references/change-primitives.md`); determines WP shape, testing strategy, and risk profile |
| `group` | The Minto-pyramid group (expand / reorganise / substitute / contract / reinforce) — derived from primitive but recorded for clarity |
| `composite_of` | When the WP is a composite (Migrate, Encapsulate, Branch-by-Abstraction etc.), records the recipe |
| `subject_ownership` / `removal_plan` (Wrap WPs) | Enforces "No Band-Aid Wrappers" — Wrap is conditional on external subject or transitional within Strangle |
| `removal_plan` (Strangle WPs) | Prevents stuck Strangles becoming permanent wrapper rot |
| `characterisation_test` (REORGANISE WPs) | Enforces "Characterisation Tests Before Refactor" — no behaviour-preserving change without a test proving behaviour is preserved |
| Context | One-paragraph orientation for the agent picking up the WP |
| Contract | The unambiguous deliverable shape |
| Red checklist | Names the failing tests up front (RGB discipline) |
| Green checklist | Defines "boring code" as the implementation standard |
| Blue checklist | Forces the refactor step that EP-02 makes non-negotiable |
| Out of Scope | Prevents the executing agent expanding scope |
| Acceptance Evidence | Closes the loop — done means measurable |
