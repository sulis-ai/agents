"""``_session_manager.manager`` — the ``SessionManager`` core surface.

Contract: SESSION_MANAGER_CONTRACT.md §2.2 (the six consumer methods
open/send/read/health/status/close), §2.5 (offset/cursor read delegated to the
log), §2.6 (one-in-flight per key; different keys parallel), §2.9 (the
three-category error model).

The manager is the **composition root** (WPB-07) for the persistent-chat
capability: it owns the keyed registry of warm :class:`~_session_manager.\
session.Session` objects, each composing a WP-001 log + a WP-003 adapter + a
real subprocess with three pump threads. The manager depends on providers
**only through the WP-003 ``ProviderAdapter`` Protocol** — adapters are injected
as a ``{provider_name: adapter}`` dict at construction, so a new provider is one
new adapter with zero change here (§2.4, MEA-01 dependency-inward).

**The decoupling invariant (§2.2, load-bearing).** :meth:`send` returns the log
offset the turn's first event will land at and never blocks on a reply;
:meth:`read` is the only content path. A consumer composes them for
request/response convenience; the manager never bundles them.

**Liveness is owned here.** :meth:`is_alive` is the single liveness check
(``process.poll()``-style) that backs :meth:`health` and :meth:`status`. WP-005
(restart-on-death) and WP-006 (dead-process detection) consume it unchanged —
there is no separate liveness primitive.

**Three extension points** are defined here so the wave-4 Armor WPs attach
without editing the core flow, each in its own module:
:meth:`_on_process_death` (WP-005 — restart-on-death, delegates to
``lifecycle.py``), :meth:`_maintenance_tick` (WP-006 — idle-eviction / LRU
memory-cap / dead-process detection, delegates to ``maintenance.py``), and
:meth:`_guard` (WP-007 — the per-turn runaway/timeout guard, still a no-op
seam). Defining them up front is what keeps WP-005/006/007 parallelisable and
conflict-free; WP-005 + WP-006 now fill theirs by delegation, so the core flow
stayed lean.
