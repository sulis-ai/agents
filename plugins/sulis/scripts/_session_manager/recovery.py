"""``_session_manager.recovery`` — the injected retry policy + the re-auth
ticket value object (ADR-002, ADR-004).

WP-001 contributes the **shapes** the recovery driver (WP-005) and the policy
(WP-003) are built against:

- :class:`RetryPolicy` — the frozen, injected backoff policy value object, with
  the module-level :data:`DEFAULT_RETRY_POLICY` fallback constant (ADR-002).
  The same convention ``manager.py`` already uses for ``recovery_budget`` and
  the turn guards: tuning values are constructor kwargs with ``DEFAULT_*``
  module constants, selected at the composition root — never a literal buried
  in the retry loop. The path to per-run / per-provider is a composition-root
  selection, not a driver change.
- :func:`next_delay_ceiling` — the deterministic core of the backoff curve:
  the jitter-free per-attempt ceiling, and the budget-exhaustion ``None``
  signal. WP-003's full ``next_delay`` applies full jitter *within* this
  ceiling (``random_between(0, ceiling)``); pinning the ceiling here is the
  single source of truth the contract's stub table asserts against, so the
  policy and the driver agree on the curve without re-spelling it.
- :class:`ReauthTicket` — the value object ``adapter.reauth()`` returns: the
  re-login link the notification surfaces + a completion handle the driver
  waits on (ADR-003/004).

**No new error code.** Login-expiry rides the existing ``NOT_AUTHORIZED``
code from ``events.py``; this module declares no code constants.
