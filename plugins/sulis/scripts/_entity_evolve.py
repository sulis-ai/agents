"""`evolve_entity` — the shared bitemporal-evolution helper (ADR-003).

This is the one place the close-window / open-window / conditional-PROV cycle
lives. When a *living* entity changes, `evolve_entity`:

  1. reads the current open window for ``(entity_type, entity_id)`` via the
     `EntityRepository` port;
  2. closes the prior window (sets ``valid_to``) and opens a new one
     (``valid_from`` == the prior window's ``valid_to`` — the windows abut
     exactly, no gap, no overlap), carrying ``confidence`` + ``sys_status``
     from the new body;
  3. **only when ``generated_by`` is supplied** (prov:Entity types — Product,
     Opportunity) records the PROV ``wasGeneratedBy`` edge to the generating
     LifecycleRun Activity (ADR-001). ``generated_by=None`` (prov:Plan types —
     Project) moves the window but writes NO edge — putting ``wasGeneratedBy``
     on a Plan is a PROV-O type violation (ADR-002, ADR-006);
  4. persists BOTH windows as a single-file history-envelope rewrite, written
     atomically (write-tmp-then-rename) so a committed window survives a crash
     and no instant ever exposes two open windows;
  5. a byte-identical re-emit is a **no-op** (returns ``None``, opens no
     window) — idempotent re-runs do not churn history;
  6. refuses any ``entity_type`` not on the ``_LIVING_ENTITY_TYPES`` allowlist
     — Decision / LifecycleRun are append-only events and MUST NOT evolve.

Two **orthogonal** guards (ADR-003, corrected):

  - ``_LIVING_ENTITY_TYPES`` is the living-vs-events split. It admits all three
    living types (product / opportunity / project); all three get windows.
  - the PROV write is a *separate* conditional, gated by
    ``generated_by is not None``. Product / Opportunity supply a ref and get
    the edge; Project supplies ``None`` and gets none.

This helper sits **above** the `EntityRepository` port (EXPAND-Create, not a
wrap — the domain owns the port): it works unchanged against the repo-local
file adapter or the central Tenant home (ADR-005), with zero adapter-specific
branches. It reuses the port's ``validate`` for reject-on-invalid and the
adapter's instance-path layout for placement.

There is **no ``used`` parameter** — canonical v2.1.0 LifecycleRun has no
``used`` field (DR-013 settled its field-set with content-addressed
``inputs_ref`` / ``outputs_ref``); modelling consumed inputs as ABox
``prov:used`` triples is a separate, later concern. ``wasRevisionOf`` is
written nowhere — version lineage is the bitemporal window chain itself.
