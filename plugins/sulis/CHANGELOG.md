# Sulis — Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-23

Canonical-plugin scope expansion. Sulis is now the front-door for founders;
the marketplace's other plugins remain operator-facing specialists.

### Added

- `agents/concierge.md` — migrated from `sulis-concierge/agents/concierge.md`.
  Internal cross-references updated (`/sulis-concierge:` → `/sulis:`;
  `claude --agent sulis-concierge` → `claude --agent sulis`).
- `skills/start/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `skills/handoff/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `skills/status/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `references/journey-model.md` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `references/subagent-dispatch.md` — migrated from sulis-concierge.

### Changed

- Plugin description rewritten — no longer "meta-skills only". Now describes
  the canonical-plugin role: hosts the concierge + journey skills (founder
  surface) AND the meta-skill methodology (skill-author surface).
- Keywords updated: added `canonical`, `founder-facing`, `concierge`,
  `front-door`. Kept `meta-skill`, `skill-authoring`, `methodology`,
  `marketplace`.
- README expanded with the layered marketplace diagram showing sulis as the
  front door above the specialist plugins.

### Removed

- Nothing removed from sulis itself. The sulis-concierge plugin is deprecated
  separately (see its CHANGELOG).

### Migration notes

- Founders previously running `claude --agent sulis-concierge` now run
  `claude --agent sulis`. Same persona, same journey, same JOURNEY.md
  location.
- `/sulis-concierge:start`, `/sulis-concierge:handoff`, `/sulis-concierge:status`
  → `/sulis:start`, `/sulis:handoff`, `/sulis:status`. Same behaviour.
- Other plugins that reference `sulis-concierge` as a peer (srd, sea,
  sulis-execution) updated separately to point at `sulis`.

### Rationale

Sib's original feedback was that the marketplace's core plugins should
collapse into one front door — the founder shouldn't have to know there are
many plugins. Rather than literally merge every plugin, the cleaner fix is
to make `sulis` the canonical front-door plugin and keep the others as
operator-facing internals. The concierge agent + journey skills were
already the founder-facing surface; moving them into `sulis` makes the
brand-name match the surface.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-23

Initial release. Establishes the meta-plugin home for skill-authoring methodology.

### Added

- `add-skill` skill — five-gate authoring methodology (Find → Scope Lock → Generate → Evaluate → Adversarial Review)
  - `SKILL.md` — entrypoint with the five gates
  - `references/methodology.md` — detailed rationale for each gate
  - `references/kinds-and-tools-learnings.md` — the source learnings transplanted from `/Users/iain/Documents/repos/platform/.specifications/kinds-and-tools/`
  - `references/completeness-perspectives.md` — how to evaluate each gate
  - `scripts/inventory.py` — deterministic Find phase: scans marketplace for jargon collisions, existing references, prior-art gotchas
  - `templates/SKILL.md.template` — starter for new SKILL.md files
  - `templates/VOCABULARY.md.template` — vocabulary section pattern
  - `templates/COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md.template` — per-gate completion report

### Rationale

The marketplace previously had `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` (97 lines —
categories, gotchas, progressive disclosure) as a beginner's how-to. It
described tactics but not methodology. New skills drifted in quality.

This plugin codifies the methodology: a five-gate flow that front-loads
discovery (collisions, jargon, prior art), locks scope before writing,
gates publish on completeness + adversarial review. Grounded in the
patterns the kinds-and-tools spec validated for getting consistent
outcomes from agent-driven authoring.
