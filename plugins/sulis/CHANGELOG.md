# Sulis — Changelog

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-23

First founder-facing aggregator skill ships. Also the first dogfood run of
the `add-skill` methodology.

### Added

- `skills/inbox/` — the founder's one-screen view of all attention-items.
  - `SKILL.md` — five-step invocation flow (resolve project → run
    aggregator → translate to founder English → present with shortcuts →
    handle shortcut with echo-first + destructive-prompt-required)
  - `scripts/aggregator.py` — deterministic data gatherer over paused
    trains (`.architecture/{project}/train-runs/*.state.json`), BLOCKERs
    (`.architecture/{project}/work-packages/BLOCKER-WP-*.md`), and
    review-needed security findings (`.security/{project}/findings/*.md`)
    where `triage: pending`. Includes `--doctor` source-existence check.
  - `references/sources-of-truth.md` — contract document mapping each
    attention-item category to its on-disk source path; phase translation
    table; doctor allow-list.
  - `COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md` — five-gate audit trail. Verdict: APPROVED
    with three documented OPEN_RISKs.

### Dogfood findings

This was the first production use of `sulis:add-skill` (v0.1.0). Ten
methodology gaps surfaced; all recorded in
`skills/inbox/COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md` under "Methodology feedback". The
gaps will feed into `add-skill` v0.2.0 (next commit). Notable:

1. Gate 2 needs an `Audience` lock item (founder-facing / operator-facing / both)
2. Categories list in `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` is operator-biased
3. Inventory script not domain-aware for aggregator skills
4. Founder-facing skills need a `founder-facing-conventions.md` reference
5. Adversarial-sweep checklist needs audience-conditional items
6. Misuse cases sometimes surface during Gate 4 (not just Gate 5)
7. OPEN_RISK needs a structured revisit-trigger field
8. Aggregator-pattern skills are a sub-family worth recognising

### Verification

- Doctor + empty-state path tested against real platform repo
  (`/Users/iain/Documents/repos/platform`, project `kinds-and-tools`):
  surfaced 16 real security findings; 0 paused trains; 0 blockers;
  may-be-empty allow-list working correctly.
- Synthetic populated fixture tested all three categories: 1 paused
  train (filter discipline verified — a `success`-phase train was
  correctly excluded), 1 pending finding (filter discipline verified —
  a `triage: accepted` finding was correctly excluded), 1 BLOCKER (with
  WP slug correctly extracted from sibling WP file).

### Open risks accepted at publication

1. Presentation cap not enforced in SKILL.md template (16 items in one
   category overwhelms founder). Revisit when first real founder use
   surfaces >10 in any category.
2. Dismissal write-back not implemented in v1.0 (read-only inbox).
   Will land in v1.1.
3. Trigger accuracy ~80–85% precision; legitimate concept-overlap with
   sulis:status / sulis:next / wpx-findings.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-23

Canonical-plugin scope expansion. Sulis is now the front-door for founders;
the marketplace's other plugins remain operator-facing specialists.

### Added

- `agents/concierge.md` — migrated from `sulis-concierge/agents/concierge.md`.
  Internal cross-references updated (`/sulis-concierge:` → `/sulis:`;
  `claude --agent sulis-concierge` → `claude --agent sulis`).
- `skills/start/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `skills/handoff/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `skills/status/` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `references/journey-model.md` — migrated from sulis-concierge.
- `references/subagent-dispatch.md` — migrated from sulis-concierge.

### Changed

- Plugin description rewritten — no longer "meta-skills only". Now describes
  the canonical-plugin role: hosts the concierge + journey skills (founder
  surface) AND the meta-skill methodology (skill-author surface).
- Keywords updated: added `canonical`, `founder-facing`, `concierge`,
  `front-door`. Kept `meta-skill`, `skill-authoring`, `methodology`,
  `marketplace`.
- README expanded with the layered marketplace diagram showing sulis as the
  front door above the specialist plugins.

### Removed

- Nothing removed from sulis itself. The sulis-concierge plugin is deprecated
  separately (see its CHANGELOG).

### Migration notes

- Founders previously running `claude --agent sulis-concierge` now run
  `claude --agent sulis`. Same persona, same journey, same JOURNEY.md
  location.
- `/sulis-concierge:start`, `/sulis-concierge:handoff`, `/sulis-concierge:status`
  → `/sulis:start`, `/sulis:handoff`, `/sulis:status`. Same behaviour.
- Other plugins that reference `sulis-concierge` as a peer (srd, sea,
  sulis-execution) updated separately to point at `sulis`.

### Rationale

Sib's original feedback was that the marketplace's core plugins should
collapse into one front door — the founder shouldn't have to know there are
many plugins. Rather than literally merge every plugin, the cleaner fix is
to make `sulis` the canonical front-door plugin and keep the others as
operator-facing internals. The concierge agent + journey skills were
already the founder-facing surface; moving them into `sulis` makes the
brand-name match the surface.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-23

Initial release. Establishes the meta-plugin home for skill-authoring methodology.

### Added

- `add-skill` skill — five-gate authoring methodology (Find → Scope Lock → Generate → Evaluate → Adversarial Review)
  - `SKILL.md` — entrypoint with the five gates
  - `references/methodology.md` — detailed rationale for each gate
  - `references/kinds-and-tools-learnings.md` — the source learnings transplanted from `/Users/iain/Documents/repos/platform/.specifications/kinds-and-tools/`
  - `references/completeness-perspectives.md` — how to evaluate each gate
  - `scripts/inventory.py` — deterministic Find phase: scans marketplace for jargon collisions, existing references, prior-art gotchas
  - `templates/SKILL.md.template` — starter for new SKILL.md files
  - `templates/VOCABULARY.md.template` — vocabulary section pattern
  - `templates/COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md.template` — per-gate completion report

### Rationale

The marketplace previously had `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` (97 lines —
categories, gotchas, progressive disclosure) as a beginner's how-to. It
described tactics but not methodology. New skills drifted in quality.

This plugin codifies the methodology: a five-gate flow that front-loads
discovery (collisions, jargon, prior art), locks scope before writing,
gates publish on completeness + adversarial review. Grounded in the
patterns the kinds-and-tools spec validated for getting consistent
outcomes from agent-driven authoring.
