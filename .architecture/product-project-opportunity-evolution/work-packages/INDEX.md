## What changed in this re-cut (15 → 13)

> Reworked 2026-06-03 against a brain-governance review. The design DIRECTION was right;
> specific mechanics were corrected.

| Action | WPs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Collapsed 3 → 1 (atomic)** | old WP-002 (author v2.1.0 schema) + old WP-003 (`_lifecyclerun_emission` step+step_label) + old WP-004 (`_brain_emit_helper` resolution) → **new WP-002** (surgical re-vendor of canonical v2.1.0 + emitter-core migration, ONE atomic WP) | ADR-004 + the `brain/compiled/README.md` mandate lockstep: schema + `_brain_emit_helper` move together. Any split leaves a reject-on-invalid window. LifecycleRun v2.1.0 is ALREADY MINTED upstream (DR-009 + DR-013) — the action is re-vendor, not author. `step_label` + `used`-on-run DROPPED (not in canonical; DR-013 rejected payload-on-run-record). |
| **Reshaped** | old WP-008 (snake_case `was_generated_by` on Product/Opportunity/**Project**) → **new WP-008** (`prov_constraints` `wasGeneratedBy` edge on **Product + Opportunity ONLY**, upstream-gated) | PROV is NOT greenfield: `wasGeneratedBy` already in the PD `_predicate_map`, already wired on 5 entities as `prov_constraints`. Reuse the convention, not a new snake_case wire field. **Project dropped** — `prov:Plan`, type violation. The grammar change is routed through the mint (upstream gate). |
| **Narrowed** | WP-009 (evolve helper), WP-012 (apply-evolve) | Provenance write is now **conditional** — Product/Opportunity get `wasGeneratedBy`; Project gets windows + supersedes but **no prov edge** (`generated_by=None`). `used` parameter removed from the helper. |
| **Kept (terminology corrected)** | WP-001 (Step = `prov:Plan`; run *instantiates* it via `sulis:viaStep`, not "typed by" it) | The `step` ref decision was correct; only the word was loose. |
| **Kept intact** | WP-005, WP-006, WP-007, WP-010, WP-011, WP-013, WP-014, WP-015 | Largely unchanged (deps re-pointed from old WP-003/WP-004 to the merged WP-002; `step_label` corrected to `run_id`). |

WP IDs 003 and 004 are intentionally retired (absorbed into WP-002, recorded in its
`composite_of`). The remaining IDs are stable to preserve the dependency graph.

## Status Summary

## Primitive Distribution

| Group | Primitive | Count | WPs |
|---|---|---|---|
| GENERATE | Create | 3 | WP-001, WP-006, WP-009 |
| SUBSTITUTE | Strangle | 4 | WP-002, WP-005, WP-008, WP-016 |

| REORGANISE | Refactor | 2 | WP-012, WP-015 |
| REINFORCE | Test | 2 | WP-011, WP-014 |
| REUSE | Reuse | 1 | WP-013 |

> **One-line:** 3 Create · 4 Substitute-Strangle · 2 Extend · 2 Refactor ·
> 2 Reinforce-Test · 1 Reuse.

> The two REORGANISE-Refactor WPs (WP-012 apply-evolve, WP-015 minter-reconcile)
> each carry a `characterisation_test:` field and `dependsOn` a REINFORCE-Test WP
> (WP-011, WP-014) that pins the baseline FIRST — per the Characterisation-Tests-
> Before-Refactor MUST. The four SUBSTITUTE-Strangle WPs carry `removal_plan`:
> WP-002 (the breaking `step_name`→`step` swap + the atomic re-vendor; `composite_of`
> records the three absorbed moves), WP-005 (the `--step-name` CLI deprecated alias),
> WP-008 (the replaced Product 1.0.0 / Opportunity 2.0.0 schemas), WP-016 (the
> replaced LifecycleRun 2.1.0 schema → additive 2.2.0 successor adding `for_project`;
> an additive drop-in, no instance migration, no reject-on-invalid window). WP-013 is `reuse`
> — the existing file adapter at the existing central Tenant home (ADR-005); its
> Blue gate asserts no new persistence code, the proof that it is reuse not build.

## Kind Distribution

| Kind | Count | WPs |
|---|---|---|
| contract | 4 | WP-001 (canonical Steps), WP-002 (re-vendor lifecyclerun 2.1.0 + emitter), WP-008 (prov_constraints edge re-vendor), WP-016 (re-vendor lifecyclerun 2.2.0 + for_project emit) |
| backend | 10 | WP-005, WP-006, WP-007, WP-009, WP-010, WP-011, WP-012, WP-013, WP-014, WP-015 |

> **Cross-kind seam:** not triggered. Kind set is {contract, backend} — no `frontend`
> or `async`. `founder_facing: false`: grammar / store / emitter work, no visual
> contract. Contract-first ordering holds: the three `contract` WPs land at the head;
> every backend WP `dependsOn` a contract WP directly or transitively. WP-002 (the
> re-vendored v2.1.0 schema + emitter core) is the contract WP-005/WP-006/WP-007/WP-008/WP-016
> consume; WP-008 (the prov edge) is the data contract WP-009/WP-012 write against.

## Upstream Dependency (two independent load-bearing gates)

> **WP-008 starts `blocked`** on the `wasGeneratedBy` mint. Everything it blocks
> (WP-009 → WP-010 → WP-011 → WP-012 → WP-013 → WP-014 → WP-015) is transitively gated.
>
> **WP-016 starts `blocked`** on the **separate** `for_project` mint (LifecycleRun
> 2.2.0). It is a leaf — it blocks nothing. The two gates are independent (different
> schemas, no ordering between them).

### Gate 1 — the `wasGeneratedBy` mint (WP-008)

The `wasGeneratedBy` edge on Product + Opportunity is a **brain grammar change**, not
an in-repo author. It is routed through the mint-request
`.specifications/business-dna/mint-requests/wasgeneratedby-provenance-edge-2026-06-03.md`
(currently a PROPOSAL). The in-repo WP-008 can only land once:

1. the mint is **ACCEPTED** by the founder + ontology owner;
2. a `/sulis-brain:mint-coach` **walk** runs the discipline (compile → admission gate →
   C1–C7 rubric → Decision Record);
3. the bumped **Product 1.1.0 + Opportunity 2.1.0** compiled schemas are **re-vendored**
   into canonical compiled output.

Only then does WP-008 re-vendor those two compiled schemas into
`plugins/sulis/brain/compiled/product-development/`, and only then can WP-009 (the evolve
helper that writes the edge) proceed.

### Gate 2 — the `for_project` mint (WP-016)

The `for_project` edge on LifecycleRun is a **separate** brain grammar change (a
DIFFERENT mint on a DIFFERENT schema), routed through the mint-request
`.specifications/business-dna/mint-requests/for-project-edge-2026-06-03.md`
(currently a PROPOSAL). The in-repo WP-016 can only land once: the mint is ACCEPTED →
a `/sulis-brain:mint-coach` walk runs the discipline → the bumped **LifecycleRun
2.2.0** compiled schema (PD canonical + insurance mirror) is **re-vendored**.

Only then does WP-016 re-vendor the v2.2.0 schema over WP-002's v2.1.0 file (additive
`for_project` ref) and wire the change-start emit path. **`sulis:forProject` + the
`ref→project` shape already resolve** (live on `Workflow.for_project`), so the mint is
a clean additive MINOR — no new predicate, no `@context` map, no instance migration,
no reject-on-invalid window. The two gates have **no ordering**: either mint can clear
first; WP-016 (a leaf off WP-002 + WP-013) and WP-008 (the prov chain head) are
independent.

**WPs that CAN land before EITHER gate clears** (no provenance + no for_project
dependency): WP-001, WP-002, WP-005, WP-006, WP-007 — the entire LifecycleRun
re-vendor + migration spine. The
LifecycleRun v2.1.0 schema is **already minted** (DR-009 + DR-013), so its re-vendor (WP-002)
is unblocked immediately. WP-002's emitter migration does NOT depend on the Product/
Opportunity prov edge — it is the run-side `step_name`→`step` swap only.

**Project requires NO brain edit** — it stays `prov:Plan` at schema_version 1.0.0, excluded
from the mint. Its WP work (WP-014, WP-015) is bitemporal windows + supersedes only.

## Wrap Audit

> All Wrap WPs reviewed for No-Band-Aid-Wrappers compliance.

| WP | Subject | Ownership | Removal Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | — | — | — | — |

No Wrap WPs proposed. The decision-priority walk landed on **Reuse** for the
Platform store (WP-013), **Refactor** for the two emitter/minter changes (WP-012,
WP-015 — edited in place, gated by characterisation tests), **Create** for the evolve
helper (WP-009 — a new helper *above* the port the domain owns, EXPAND-Create per the
Ports-vs-Wrappers rule, not a Wrap over the SDK), and **Substitute-Strangle** for the
three breaking/replace WPs (WP-002 the re-vendor+emitter swap, WP-005 the CLI alias,
WP-008 the prov-edge schema replacement) — each a deprecate-then-replace with a
`removal_plan`, not a wrap. No wrapper rot on existing modules.

**Totals:** ~49k input + ~47k output ≈ 96k tokens for the full WP set (the for_project
increment adds ~6k; still below the pre-rework ~99k — the 3→1 collapse removed
duplicated schema/emitter scaffolding; the narrowed prov WP dropped Project + the
snake_case grammar authoring).

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Wave 1 (sole):** WP-001 (canonical Steps — prov:Plan defs) — head of graph.
2. **Wave 2 (sole):** WP-002 (the ATOMIC re-vendor + emitter-core lockstep) — the
   whole `step_name`→`step` swap lands here as one WP (no reject-on-invalid window).
3. **Wave 3 (parallel, 3 WPs — peak):** WP-005 (CLI), WP-006 (instance migration),
   WP-007 (drift parity) — all unblocked by WP-002, independent code surfaces.
   **+ WP-008 starts here IF the upstream mint has cleared** (else it waits).
4. **Wave 4 (sole, gated):** WP-009 (`_entity_evolve`) — needs WP-008's prov edge
   (upstream-gated).
5. **Wave 5 (parallel, 2 WPs):** WP-010 (as-of read), WP-011 (emit characterisation
   test) — unblocked by WP-009.
6. **Wave 6 (parallel, 2 WPs):** WP-012 (apply-evolve refactor — needs WP-009 +
   WP-011), WP-013 (central home wiring — needs WP-009 + WP-002 + WP-010 for
   shared-file serialisation).
7. **Wave 7 (parallel, up to 2 WPs):** WP-014 (minter characterisation test — needs
   WP-012 + WP-013); **WP-016 (for_project v2.2.0 increment — needs WP-002 + WP-005 +
   WP-013, AND gated on the for_project mint)** can land here once its mint clears.
   WP-016 is independent of WP-014/WP-015 — it is a leaf.
8. **Wave 8 (sole):** WP-015 (minter reconcile refactor) — needs WP-014.

> **WP-016 has no fixed wave** — it lands the moment BOTH (a) WP-002 + WP-013 are
> merged AND (b) the for_project mint is re-vendored. If its mint clears early it can
> land as soon as WP-013 is in (wave 7); if late, it lands whenever the mint clears,
> independent of the WP-014/WP-015 tail. It blocks nothing.

Critical path: **WP-001 → WP-002 → WP-008 → WP-009 → WP-011 → WP-012 → WP-014 →
WP-015** (8 sequential merges, WP-008 gated on the wasGeneratedBy mint). **WP-016 is
NOT on the critical path** — it is a gated leaf off WP-002 + WP-013. Peak parallelism
is 3 (wave 3). The pre-gate spine (WP-001, WP-002, WP-005, WP-006, WP-007) can all
land while BOTH mints are in review.
